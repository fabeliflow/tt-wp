                            Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. What's this? What is what?!? He asked you a question... What is that? Help
                            me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Oh, he
                            says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind. Who is she? She's beautiful.
                            I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi... I think she was a passenger on
                            our last voyage. A person of some importance, sir -- I believe. Our captain was attached to...
                            Is there more to this recording? Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going to get us in trouble. Sandpeople!
                            Or worst! Come on, let's have a look. Come on. There are two Banthas down there but I don't see
                            any...wait a second, they're Sandpeople all right. I can see one of them now. Let me see your
                            identification. You don't need to see his identification. We don't need to see his identification.
                            These are not the droids your looking for. These are not the droids we're looking for. He can
                            go about his business. You can go about your business. Move along. Move along. Move along. Jabba's
                            through with you. He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of
                            an Imperial cruiser. Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice? You can tell
                            that to Jabba. He may only take your ship. Over my dead body. That's the idea. I've been looking
                            forward to killing you for a long time. Yes, I'll bet you have. Sorry about the mess. Here they
                            come! They're coming in too fast! Oooh! We've lost lateral controls. Don't worry, she'll hold
                            together. You hear me, baby? Hold together! Got him! I got him! Great kid! Don't get cocky. There
                            are still two more of them out there! That's it! We did it! We did it! Help! I think I'm melting!
                            This is all your fault. There she is. See-Threepio, do you copy? For the moment. Uh, we're in
                            the main hangar across from the ship. We're right above you. Stand by. You came in that thing?
                            You're braver that I thought. Nice! Come on! It's them! Blast them! Get back to the ship! Where
                            are you going? Come back! He certainly has courage. What good will it do us if he gets himself
                            killed? Come on! I think we took a wrong turn. There's no lock! That oughta hold it for a while.
                            Quick, we've got to get across. Find the control that extends the bridge. Oh, I think I just
                            blasted it. They're coming through! Here, hold this. Here they come! For luck!

                            Oh! The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea. What an incredible smell you've discovered! Let's get out of here! Get
                            away from there... No! wait! Will you forget it? I already tried it. It's magnetically sealed!
                            Put that thing away! You're going to get us all killed. Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had
                            everything under control until you led us down here. You know, it's not going to take them long
                            to figure out what happened to us. It could be worst... It's worst. There's something alive in
                            here! That's your imagination. Something just moves past my leg! Look! Did you see that? What?
                            Help!

                        <p>
                            Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They're more dangerous
                            than you realize. Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander, not to this battle station! The Rebellion
                            will continue to gain a support in the Imperial Senate as long as.... The Imperial Senate will
                            no longer be of any concern to us. I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the
                            council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away. That's impossible!
                            How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy? The regional governors now have
                            direct control over territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle

                            Yes. Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted
                            for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems. She lied!
                            She lied to us! I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion. Terminate her...immediately!
                            What a piece of junk. She'll make point five beyond the speed of light. She may not look like
                            much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've added some special modifications myself. We're
                            a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here. Hello, sir. Which way? All
                            right, men. Load your weapons! Stop that ship! Blast 'em! Chewie, get us out of here! Oh, my.
                            I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.

                                    load lifter...very similar to your vaporators. You could say... Do you speak Bocce? Of
                                    course I can, sir. It's like a second language for me...I'm as fluent in... All right

                                    Hello there! Come here my little friend. Don't be afraid. Don't worry, he'll be all right. What happened? Rest easy, son,
                                    you've had a busy day. You're fortunate you're still in one piece. Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy,
                                    am I glad to see you! The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me young
                                    Luke, what brings you out this far? Oh, this little droid! I think he's searching for
                                    his former master...I've never seen such devotion in a droid before...there seems to
                                    be no stopping him. He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative
                                    of yours? Do you know who he's talking about?
                                </p>

                            It looks like Sandpeople did this, all right. Look, here are Gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks. It's just...I never heard of them
                            hitting anything this big before. They didn't. But we are meant to think they did. These tracks
                            are side by side. Sandpeople always ride single file to hide there numbers. These are the same
                            Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio. And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople. Only
                            Imperial stormtroopers are so precise. Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas? If
                            they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to. And that would lead
                            them home! Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous. Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen!

                            Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed
                            first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen
                            to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan. No! Alderaan is
                            peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly... You would prefer another target? A military
                            target? Then name the system! I grow tired of asking this. So it'll be the last time. Where is
                            the Rebel base? Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.

                            Red Leader... This is Gold Leader. We're starting out attack run. I copy, Gold Leader. Move into position. Stay in attack
                            formation! The exhaust post is... marked and locked in! Switch power to front deflector screens.
                            How many guns do you think, Gold Five. I'd say about twenty guns. Some on the surface, some on
                            the towers. Death Star will be in range in five minutes. Switching to targeting computer. Computer's
                            locked. Getting a signal. The guns...they've stopped! Stabilize your read deflectors. Watch for
                            enemy fighters. Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined
                            the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with
                            the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on
                            your home planet of Alderaan. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly...
                            You would prefer another target? A military target? Then name the system! I grow tired of asking
                            this. So it'll be the last time. Where is the Rebel base? Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.

                            Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next
                            to the power of the Force. Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your
                            sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or
                            given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort... I find your lack of faith disturbing.
                            Enough of this! Vader, release him! As you wish. This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will
                            provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational. We
                            will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.
